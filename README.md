## Updating for Future Years

*For now this is just here as a reminder to myself - Readme needs to be updated later lol*

When updating for future years, README needs to contain instructions reminding anyone updating this to fix the teaching week calculation, because it cannot be read from the CSV files.

You also need to update the number of files constant.
